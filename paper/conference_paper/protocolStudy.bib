The procedure essentially involves the construction of functions of the observed proportions which are directed at the extent to which the observers agree among themselves and the construction of test statistics for hypotheses involving these functions. Tests for interobserver bias are presented in terms of first-order marginal homogeneity and measures of interobserver agreement are developed as generalized kappa-type statistics. These procedures are illustrated with a clinical diagnosis example from the epidemiological literature.},

	Abstract = {Machine learning techniques are increasingly used in intelligent assistants, that is, software targeted at and continuously adapting to assist end users with email, shopping, and other tasks. Examples include desktop SPAM filters, recommender systems, and handwriting recognition. Fixing such intelligent assistants when they learn incorrect behavior, however, has received only limited attention. To directly support end-user ?debugging? of assistant behaviors learned via statistical machine learning, we present a Why-oriented approach which allows users to ask questions about how the assistant made its predictions, provides answers to these ?why? questions, and allows users to interactively change these answers to debug the assistant's current and future predictions. To understand the strengths and weaknesses of this approach, we then conducted an exploratory study to investigate barriers that participants could encounter when debugging an intelligent assistant using our approach, and the information those participants requested to overcome these barriers. To help ensure the inclusiveness of our approach, we also explored how gender differences played a role in understanding barriers and information needs. We then used these results to consider opportunities for Why-oriented approaches to address user barriers and information needs.},

To lower the barrier for creating mashups, we have extended the CoScripter web automation tool with a spreadsheet-like environment called Vegemite. Our system uses direct-manipulation and programming-by-demonstration tech-niques to automatically populate tables with information collected from various web sites. A particular strength of our approach is its ability to augment a data set with new values computed by a web site, such as determining the driving distance from a particular location to each of the addresses in a data set. An informal user study suggests that Vegemite may enable a wider class of users to address their information needs.},

Currently, the literature describing DHC efforts so far is segmented. Projects that stem from different perspectives frequently do not cite each other. This can be especially problematic for researchers trying to understand the current body of work in order to push forward with new ideas. Also, as DHC matures into a standard topic within humancomputer interaction and computer science, educators will require a common vocabulary to teach from. As a starting point, we offer a taxonomy which classifies and compares DHC systems and ideas. We describe the key characteristics and compare and contrast the differing approaches.},

@article{Smith2008,
	Abstract = {Today's corpus tools offer the user a wide range of features that greatly facilitate
the linguistic analysis of large amounts of authentic language data (e.g. frequency
distributions, collocations, keywords, etc.). However, these tools typically fail to
address the fundamental need of the linguist to add interpretive information to a
concordance or query result, by coding individual concordance lines for
structural, functional, discoursal, and other features in a flexible way. The ability
to add such qualitative data is indispensable to a fuller understanding of the
phenomenon under investigation as it allows the linguist to produce more
rigorous descriptions---and theories---about language in use.
Our article has two aims: first, to assess the merits and drawbacks of existing
solutions, by surveying what can be achieved using state-of-the-art corpus tools
and generic database software; second, we draw up a set of desiderata and
recommendations for the incorporation of flexible encoding features into future
corpus tools. We describe an initial step in this direction, with a recent enhancement
to the BNCweb corpus analysis software. More generally, we hope our
suggestions will lead to linguists and software developers working together more
closely to ensure that the needs of the former are provided for by the available
technology.},

We discuss about a user-hostile system. We decided that the terms kludge and work-around, and also the related concept of make-work, has yet to be clearly defined for the intelligent systems community. Human-centered systems are different from user-hostile systems as well as from systems based on a designer-centered approach. We try to clarify the senses of these three terms and suggest ways we might study work-around, make-work, and kludges as an integral part of human-computer systems-rather than as embarrassing necessities that are best swept under the computing research rug.},

It will involve very close coupling between the human and the electronic members of the partnership. The main aims are 1) to let computers facilitate formulative thinking as they now facilitate the solution of formulated problems, and 2) to enable men and computers to cooperate in making decisions and controlling complex situations without inflexible dependence on predetermined programs. In the anticipated symbiotic partnership, men will set the goals, formulate the hypotheses, determine the criteria, and perform the evaluations. Computing machines will do the routinizable work that must be done to prepare the way for insights and decisions in technical and scientific thinking. Preliminary analyses indicate that the symbiotic partnership will perform intellectual operations much more effectively than man alone can perform them. Prerequisites for the achievement of the effective, cooperative association include developments in computer time sharing, in memory components, in memory organization, in programming languages, and in input and output equipment.},

@article{Dai2010,
	Abstract = {Crowd-sourcing is a recent framework in which human intelligence tasks are outsourced to a crowd of unknown people (''workers'') as an open call (e.g., on Amazon's Mechanical Turk). Crowd-sourcing has become immensely popular with hoards of employers (''requesters''), who use it to solve a wide variety of jobs, such as dictation transcription, content screening, etc. To achieve quality results, requesters often subdivide a large task into a chain of bite-sized subtasks that are combined into a complex, iterative workflow in which workers check and improve each other's results. This raises an exciting question for AI --- could an autonomous agent control these workflows without human intervention, yielding better results than today's state of the art, a fixed control program? We plan to study this AI problem, and hope to build an autonomous agent to control crowd-sourcing workflows. This paper shows some initial results by presenting a planner TURKONTROL, that formulates workflow control as a decision-theoretic optimization problem, trading off the implicit quality of a solution artifact against the cost for workers to achieve it. We lay the mathematical framework to govern the various decisions at each point in a popular class of workflows. Based on our analysis we implement the workflow control algorithm and present experiments demonstrating that TURKONTROL obtains much higher utilities than popular fixed policies.

	Abstract = {We describe a study of the use of decision-theoretic policies for optimally joining human and automated problem-solving efforts. We focus specifically on the challenge of determining when it is best to transfer callers from an automated dialog system to human receptionists. We demonstrate the sensitivities of transfer actions to both the inferred competency of the spoken-dialog models and the current sensed load on human receptionists. The policies draw upon probabilistic models constructed via machine learning from cases that were logged by a call routing service deployed at our organization. We describe the learning of models that predict outcomes and interaction times and show how these models can be used to generate expected-utility policies that identify when it is best to transfer callers to human operators. We explore the behavior of the policies with simulations constructed from real-world call data.},

However, the growth is not adequately supported by a framework with which to understand each new system in the context of the old. We classify human computation systems to help identify parallels between different systems and reveal ―holes‖ in the existing work as opportunities for new research. Since human computation is often confused with ―crowdsourcing‖ and other terms, we explore the position of human computation with respect to these related topics.},

	Abstract = {The advantages of today's processmanagement, such as efficiency and quality aspects,are achieved by enforcing detailed models of workprocesses. However, real world processes can beplanned to a limited degree only and sometimes plannedparts of the process must be changed,creating a need for additional, unforeseen activities.This paper suggests an approach that configuresparts of a detailed process model with differentsupport strategies. The explicit modelling of thesesupport strategies allows them to be changed ifdemanded by the situation. When enacting such aprocess model it is then possible to vary the degreeto which the model determines the work ofindividuals. The concept is based on an earlierenactment concept which allowed workers to freelychoose methods for their tasks according to thesituation. Besides the incorporation of differentsupport strategies, the extended enactment strategygives workers the opportunity to negotiate aboutchanging a currently too restrictive support strategy,giving scope for deviations from the plannedprocess where additional actions are required.},

@article{Gasser1986,
	Abstract = {Most computing serves as a resource or tool to support other work: performing complex analyses for engineering projects, preparing documents, or sending electronic mail using office automation equipment, etc. To improve the character, quality, and ease of computing work, we must understand how automated systems actually are integrated into the work they support. How do people actually adapt to computing as a resource? How do they deal with the unreliability in hardware, software, or operations; data inaccuracy; system changes; poor documentation; inappropriate designs; etc.; which are present in almost every computing milieu, even where computing is widely used and considered highly successful? This paper presents some results of a detailed empirical study of routine computer use in several organizations. We present a theoretical account of computing work and use it to explain a number of observed phenomena, such as: -How people knowingly use ``false'' data to obtain desired analytical results by tricking their systems. -How organizations come to rely upon complex, critical computer systems despite significant, recurrent, known errors and inaccurate data. -How people work around inadequate computing systems by using manual or duplicate systems, rather than changing their systems via maintenance or enhancement. In addition, the framework for analyzing computing and routine work presented here proves useful for representing and reasoning about activity in multiactor systems in general, and in understanding how better to integrate organizations of people and computers in which work is coordinated.},

	Abstract = {In this paper, we argue that universality is always `local universality'. The achievement of local universality depends on how standards manage the tension involved in transforming work practices, while simultaneously being grounded in those practices. We investigate how this is done in two case studies -- an oncology protocol and the Cardio Pulmonary Resuscitation (CPR) protocol. These protocols are viewed as technoscientific scripts which crystallize multiple trajectories. In the process of obtaining local universality, we illustrate how protocols feed off previous standards and practices. We then indicate how the protocols function through the distributed work of a multitude of heterogeneous actors. Finally, we argue that, in this process, the protocols themselves are necessarily changed and partially reappropriated.},

@article{Benninger1983,
	Abstract = {Many factors contribute to the severity of neuronal cell death and the functional outcome in stroke. We describe an embolic model of focal cerebral ischemia in the rat that does not require craniotomy and is compatible with continuous measurement of regional CBF using multichannel laser Doppler flow (LDF) technique. Either a 22 microliters (large lesion) or 11 microliters (small lesion) bolus of viscous silicone was injected cephalad into the internal carotid artery. Upon injection, LDF decreased abruptly, most severely in the parietal cortex (-74\% 5\%) in the large lesion and in the occipital cortex (-69\% 10\%) in the small lesion model. Over the first hour, post-embolization LDF improved in most areas (e.g. -48\% 9\% parietal, large lesion) but declined in the small lesion group in the occipital region (-81\% 8\%). CBF measured by C14-IAP autoradiography 1 h post-embolization in the large lesion model demonstrated near-hemispheric ischemia (70\% of hemisphere) with sparing of cingulate cortex. Autoradiography demonstrated that ischemia in the small lesion was largely cortical. Light microscopy of brains embolized with 11 microliters of dyed silicone showed filling of pial vessels with no silicone in the Circle of Willis or parenchyma. No animals in the large lesion group survived 24 h. Thirteen of 15 animals in the small lesion group survived for two weeks with resolution of initial hemiplegia, ocular asymmetry and weight loss. Hematoxylin-eosin staining two weeks post-embolization showed signs of severe hypoxia and infarction. In conclusion, the intracarotid silicone embolization technique produces a titrable, reproducible permanent ischemic injury by blocking perfusion in the pial circulation, and is amenable to multisite monitoring with laser Doppler flowmetry. The smaller embolus produces cortical infarction with high rate of survival and neurological recovery.},

@article{Lynch2002,
	Abstract = {Protocols are one of the main organizational resources in molecular biology. They are written instructions that specify ingredients, equipment, and sequences of steps for making technical preparations. Some protocols are published in widely used manuals, while others are hand-written variants used by particular laboratories and individual technicians. It is widely understood, both in molecular biology and in social studies of science, that protocols do not describe exactly what practitioners do in the laboratory workplace. In social studies of science, the difference between protocols and the actual practices of doing them often is used to set up ironic contrasts between 'messy' laboratory practices and the appearance of technical order. Alternatively, in ethnomethodological studies of work, the difference is examined as a constitutive feature, both of the lived-work of doing technical projects, and of the administrative work of regulating and evaluating such projects. The present article takes its point of departure from ethnomethodology, and begins with a discussion of local problems with performing molecular biology protocols on specific occasions. The discussion then moves to particular cases in criminal law in which defense attorneys cross-examine forensic technicians and lab administrators. In these interrogations, the distinction between protocols and actual practices animates the dialogue and becomes consequential for judgments in the case at hand. The article concludes with a discussion of administrative science: the work of treating protocols and paper trails as proxies for actual 'scientific' practices.},
